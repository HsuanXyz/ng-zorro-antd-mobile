## 0.9.0

`2018-09-29`

**NG-ZORRO** has a blue print for both PC and mobile at the very beginning of the project.

According to the specification of **Ant Design Mobile**, **Alibaba Data Technology and Product** terminal team started to develop **NG-ZORRO-MOBILE** based on **Angular >=2** in June, 2016. To prove its ability also integrate it into production.

 In the last half year in 2017, **Ant Design Mobile React** implementation started to redesign and implement with a brand new version **2.x**. To keep in pace with the React implementation, **NG-ZORRO-MOBILE** terminated the onging development and started a tight development of the all new **NG-ZORRO-MOBILE** corresponding to the **Ant Design Mobile React 2.x**.

For now, based on the latest **Angular ^6.0.0** and **RxJS ^6.0.0** , **NG-ZORRO-MOBILE** have finished all the 45 components which exist in **Ant Design Mobile React 2.x**, and have integrated with **@angular/cli** for ease of use. Meanwhile, we share the same docs&website build system with **NG-ZORRO-PC** as a uniform style.
